IS733 Group Project


#### Since 2000, the New York State Worker’s Compensation Board (WCB) has tracked their efforts related to work-related injury claims using a vast and publically accessible dataset, known as  Assembled Workers' Compensation Claims: Beginning 2000. New York State is the fourth most populous state in the United States and New York City is the largest city in the country. Our motivation comes from the real-world relevance of the dataset, as well as what it represents: how each work-related injury claim is processed from date of injury to its resolution. 
#### When the WCB learns of a workplace injury, the claim is assembled and given a WCB claim number. The WCB “assembles” a claim in the situations when: an injured worker misses more than one week of work or suffers a major injury that could leave them permanently disabled, or has a claim disputed by the carrier or employer or submits a claim form.  A claim that has been revived to address fresh problems after it was determined that no further action was required is known as a "reopened claim" (New York State Workers' Compensation Board, 2022).
